## Introduction

_It's my pleasure to introduce myself._

_I am_ 
**Akash Singh Mehta** _from Ludhiana city of Punjab. I have completed my 10+2 in science stream. Currently I am pursuing a B.Tech degree in Mechanical Engineering from_ **Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana.**

_I have choosen Mechanical Engineering because its traditional popularity. The fact that mechanical engineering demands dedication, hard work and sincerity at all times, making it a complete development of education and personality. But indeed, the most attractive reason to join Mechanical Engineering, as I think, is that you actually like designing and developing mechanical systems like Robots, Automobile parts, infrastructural parts and much more._

_Actually I am not so clear about my hobby. But I like to watch how diffrent machine parts are designed and manufactured on YouTube, so you can also consider it as my hobby._
